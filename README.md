# Deep Learning Models for Tabular Data Classification

This repository contains deep learning models designed for handling tabular datasets for classification tasks. Currently, implementing and exploring models like TabNet and NODE (Neural Oblivious Decision Ensembles) for effective tabular data analysis.

## Purpose

The main focus of this repository is to provide implementations of state-of-the-art deep learning models tailored for tabular data, with an emphasis on classification tasks. These models are designed to handle structured data efficiently and leverage the power of neural networks for predictive modeling.
